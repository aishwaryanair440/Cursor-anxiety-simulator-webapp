## ✨ Core Features

- **13 Investigative Protocols**: From kinetic obstruction to cognitive overload, each stage explores a unique dimension of UX friction.
- **Psychological Load Profile**: A specialized SVG Radar Chart in the final report that visualizes metrics across five axes: Precision, Tempo, Control, Agitation, and Friction.
- **Real-Time Bio-Stress Level**: A dynamic monitoring system that calculates "Anxiety Levels" based on missed targets, rage-clicks, and hesitation loops.
- **Premium Dark Aesthetic**: A sophisticated dark theme built with glassmorphism, vibrant gradients, and high-contrast typography for maximum visual impact.
- **Fluid Navigation**: A page-based, no-scroll layout with automatic scroll-to-top transitions for a focused, slideshow-style experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS & CSS Variables
- **Design System**: Glassmorphism with custom glass panels and backdrop blurs
- **Visuals**: Dynamic SVGs and CSS Animations (Shimmers, Pulses, Fade-ins)
